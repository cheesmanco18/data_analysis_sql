# Part 1 Analysis


* Some cardholders have roughly 15-25 transactions that are under $2.00. This seems like a decent amount - and is certainly more than "several" - so there is evidence to suggest that a card has been hacked
* The top 100 highest transactions made between 7:00 am and 9:00 am range from $11-1894. The top 8 range from $748-1894, but after that there is a steep drop to 100 and then 23 and below after that. This steep drop and limited amount of high transaction amounts may indicate potential fraud
* When looking at the top transactions the rest of the day, there is not as steep of a drop off. This indicates that there may be more fraudulent transactions between 7-9am. It could be the case that there's a more concentrated volume of transactions at this time, so it's easier to sneak in fraudulent ones. 
* The top 5 merchants prone to being hacked using small transactions (under $2) are:
"Wood-Ramirez",
"Hood-Phillips",
"Baker Inc",
"Martinez Group",
and "Riggs-Adams"

# Part 2 Analysis

* Customer 2's purchases are within a much tighter band, while customer 18 will have a series of lower transactions across 1-2 months followed by a big purchase. These abnormally large purposes that follow smaller purchases suggest that customer 18 may have been exposed to fraudulent transactions.
* Every month except for February has outliers. For the months ex-February, there are about 1-3 outliers. These are a bit odd given there is only a couple each month and all of the other purchases are close in expenditure volume. It could be the case that the CEO is making a big purchase every now and again, however it deserves more investigation.
